# Privacy Methods

Each folder under `privacy_methods/` is a self-contained privacy method benchmark area, organized by data type.

**Why this structure?**
- It allows multiple volunteer groups to work in parallel.
- Each group owns a folder (or set of folders) and can improve it incrementally.

## Data Types
- `privacy_methods/d1_structured_data/` – structured (tabular) clinical data
- `privacy_methods/d2_unstructured_data/` – clinical notes / unstructured text
