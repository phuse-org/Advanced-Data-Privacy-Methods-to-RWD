# Research

Each folder under `research/` is a self-contained research paper collection, organized by data type — mirroring `privacy_methods/`.

**Why this structure?**
- It allows multiple volunteer groups to work in parallel.
- Each group owns a folder (or set of folders) and can add papers incrementally.
- Papers are filed under the method they inform. The target is 10–15 papers per method as the collection matures; most folders currently contain initial reviews only.

## Data Types
- `research/d1_structured_data/` – structured (tabular) clinical data
- `research/d2_unstructured_data/` – clinical notes / unstructured text

## Planning
- `research/planning/` – Tech Implementation Plan, RWD data sources, strategy analysis, and task assignments
