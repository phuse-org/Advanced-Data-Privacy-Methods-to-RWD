# CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) — Access Instructions

## Overview

The CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a place-based index, database, and mapping tool developed by the Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program (GRASP) at the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), part of the CDC. The SVI is designed to identify and rank communities that may need the most support before, during, or after a disaster or public health emergency.

The SVI uses 16 U.S. Census Bureau variables to assess social vulnerability at the census tract level, organized into four thematic groupings. It ranks every census tract in the United States on a scale from 0 (lowest vulnerability) to 1 (highest vulnerability). The SVI is widely used in public health, emergency preparedness, urban planning, and health equity research.

## Access Level

**Open** — SVI data files, documentation, and mapping tools are freely available for download. No registration, application, or data use agreement is required.

## Prerequisites

None. Data can be downloaded immediately.

For working with shapefiles or geodatabases, GIS software (such as ArcGIS, QGIS, or equivalent) is recommended. For CSV/tabular data, any spreadsheet or statistical software will suffice.

## Step-by-Step Access

### Step 1: Navigate to the SVI Data Download Page

Go to the SVI Data and Documentation Download page:

[https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html)

Or use the interactive data download tool:

[https://svi.cdc.gov/dataDownloads/data-download.html](https://svi.cdc.gov/dataDownloads/data-download.html)

### Step 2: Select the Database Year

SVI databases are available for the following years:
- **2022** (latest, based on 2018--2022 ACS 5-year estimates)
- **2020** (based on 2016--2020 ACS 5-year estimates)
- **2018** (based on 2014--2018 ACS 5-year estimates)
- **2016** (based on 2012--2016 ACS 5-year estimates)
- **2014** (based on 2010--2014 ACS 5-year estimates)
- **2010** (based on 2006--2010 ACS 5-year estimates)
- **2000** (based on 2000 Decennial Census)

### Step 3: Select the Geographic Scope

Choose the geographic extent of the data:

- **United States** — All U.S. census tracts ranked against each other nationally. Use this for multi-state or nationwide analysis.
- **Individual State** — Tracts ranked against other tracts within that state only. Available for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
- **Tribal Tracts** — Available for 2022 only. Contains estimates, percentages, and margins of error but no rankings (tribal tracts are not ranked against each other or standard tracts).
- **ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)** — Available for 2022 only.

### Step 4: Select the Geographic Level

Choose the unit of analysis:
- **Census Tract** — The standard geographic unit (~4,000 people per tract)
- **County** — Aggregated county-level SVI scores

### Step 5: Choose the Data Format

Two primary formats are available:

1. **CSV File** — Tabular data suitable for statistical analysis in R, Python, SAS, Stata, or Excel
2. **ESRI File Geodatabase** — Spatial data for use in GIS applications (ArcGIS, QGIS)

### Step 6: Download and Review Documentation

Download the corresponding SVI documentation PDF for your selected year. For example:

- [SVI 2022 Documentation (PDF)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/media/pdfs/2024/10/SVI2022Documentation.pdf)

The documentation explains the 16 census variables, the four themes, the ranking methodology, and the data dictionary.

### Step 7: Explore via ArcGIS Online (Optional)

SVI 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022 are also available as interactive map layers on ArcGIS Online for visualization without downloading data.

## Data Format

- **CSV files** — Comma-separated values with one row per census tract (or county)
- **ESRI File Geodatabases** — Spatial data files with geometry and attributes
- **Documentation:** PDF files with data dictionaries and methodology descriptions

## Key Tables / Files

The SVI database contains raw census estimates, percentages, percentile rankings, and flags for each of the 16 variables organized into four themes:

**Theme 1: Socioeconomic Status**
- `EPL_POV150` — Percentile for persons below 150% poverty
- `EPL_UNEMP` — Percentile for unemployed persons (age 16+)
- `EPL_HBURD` — Percentile for housing cost burden
- `EPL_NOHSDP` — Percentile for persons with no high school diploma (age 25+)
- `EPL_UNINSUR` — Percentile for uninsured persons

**Theme 2: Household Characteristics and Disability**
- `EPL_AGE65` — Percentile for persons aged 65 and older
- `EPL_AGE17` — Percentile for persons aged 17 and younger
- `EPL_DISABL` — Percentile for persons with a disability
- `EPL_SNGPNT` — Percentile for single-parent households
- `EPL_LIMENG` — Percentile for persons with limited English proficiency

**Theme 3: Racial and Ethnic Minority Status**
- `EPL_MINRTY` — Percentile for racial/ethnic minority population

**Theme 4: Housing Type and Transportation**
- `EPL_MUNIT` — Percentile for multi-unit structures (10+ units)
- `EPL_MOBILE` — Percentile for mobile homes
- `EPL_CROWD` — Percentile for crowded housing (more people than rooms)
- `EPL_NOVEH` — Percentile for households with no vehicle
- `EPL_GROUPQ` — Percentile for persons in group quarters

**Summary Rankings:**
- `RPL_THEME1` through `RPL_THEME4` — Percentile ranking for each theme
- `RPL_THEMES` — Overall SVI percentile ranking (0 to 1)
- `F_TOTAL` — Sum of flags across all variables (tracts at 90th percentile or above receive a flag of 1)

**Geographic Identifiers:**
- `FIPS` — Census tract or county FIPS code
- `STATE` — State name
- `ST_ABBR` — State abbreviation
- `COUNTY` — County name
- `LOCATION` — Tract or county name

## Important Restrictions

- **Do not compare across SVI years:** SVI databases from different years are not directly comparable because the underlying census variables, tract boundaries, and in some cases the variable composition have changed over time. Percentile scores from different years should not be compared.
- **Tract boundary changes:** The U.S. Census Bureau redraws tract boundaries with each decennial census (2000, 2010, 2020), so tracts in different SVI editions may represent different geographies.
- **90th percentile flags:** Tracts at or above the 90th percentile receive a flag value of 1, indicating high social vulnerability. This threshold is somewhat arbitrary and should be interpreted in context.
- **Missing data:** Some tracts may have missing values (coded as -999) due to insufficient data in the American Community Survey.
